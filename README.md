# SupplyMission
Story:You are a sergeant on a military peacekeeping mission delivering essential medical supplies
and food to a designated drop zone in a zombie infested city. The zombies don't know about
this drop zone and couldn't care less about medicines.

Because of the nature of the package content, you have ensured that you pack the supplies in a safety package which is soft and will take most of the impact.

This package should bounce a couple of times, before coming to a stop.
